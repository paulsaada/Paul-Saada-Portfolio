					<h3>WVHG Compound Interest Calculator</h3>
					<p class="portfolio-type">HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, Charts.js</p>
					<p>Wells Verne (WVHG) also wanted a compound interest calculator for their website visitors to be able to use. They had three stipulations; The compound interest chart had to be animated, it had to match the design and overall theme of their website, and I had to deliver the final product with no bugs. I solved their problem by creating a modern, interactive chart that I implemented using JavaScript and Charts.js. Now their visitors can determine how much their investment can grow using the power of compound interest!</p>

						</div>

						<div class="dev-bio">
							<p>I’ve been editing HTML since 2010 when I first discovered blogging and ever since then, I caught the coding bug and kept finding new ways to solve problems using my skills as a developer. In subsequent years, I’ve added CSS and JavaScript to my skillset and I’m currently capable of creating beautiful and fully-responsive websites for individuals and businesses alike.</p> 
							<p>I pride myself in adhering to the best web practices and writing/contributing clean, sustainable code for every project I undertake.</p>
							<p>These days, I look for projects to collaborate with other developers on and finding teams where I can use my skills and interests to finding creative solutions to difficult problems.</p>
							<p>If you’d like to speak to me about possible opportunities for a front-end developer position at your company, please don’t hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.</p>
